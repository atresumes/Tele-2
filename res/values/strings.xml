Tik Tok Doc strives to help users of the Services protect their privacy while using the Services. By using the Services, you expressly consent to the use and disclosure of information as described in this Privacy Policy. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I. Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (“HIPPA”) &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Title II of HIPAA deals with the privacy and security of electronic healthcare transactions and sets forth the criteria for compliance. It includes five rules of “Administrative Simplification” intended to make healthcare more efficient and medical information more accessible. The Privacy Rule and Security Rule are the two rules related to electronic data communication. HIPAA and the Department of Health and Human Services (“HHS”) define the “covered entities” to which the rules apply as: health plans; health care clearinghouses, such as billing services and community health information systems; and health care providers that transmit healthcare data in electronic form. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;BONELLO CREATIVE GROUP, LLC &lt;/b&gt;is not a “covered entity” under HIPAA. However, it is a “business associate” of covered entities. Therefore, Bonello Creative Group, LLC may not use or disclose your protected health information (“PHI”) except as provided in its Business Associate Agreement with covered entities, which contains the same (or greater) restrictions on the use and disclosure of your PHI as required under HIPAA and relevant state laws. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Privacy Rule governs how a patient’s PHI (information about a patient’s health status, treatment, and payment1) is used and disclosed. The Privacy Rule requires covered entities and &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“Protected Health Information” or PHI includes health information that (1) is created or received by a health care provider (or business associate on behalf of a health care provider); (2) is related to your past, present, or future physical or mental health; your receipt of health care; or payment for your health care; and (3) identifies you or could likely be used to identify you. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; 1 &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; their business associates to take reasonable steps to ensure confidentiality when using, disclosing, or transmitting your PHI. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Security Rule provides standards for keeping Electronic Protected Health Information (“EPHI”) safe. The EPHI’s section on Technical Safeguards sets forth rules for access to computers and the secure communication of EPHI over public networks to protect it from interception by anyone other than the intended recipient. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Compliance with the Privacy and Security Rules lies with the covered entities who, under 45 C.F.R. 164.312, must “implement technical security measures to guard against unauthorized access to electronic protected health information that is being transmitted over an electronic communications network. As they relate to video conferencing, these measures include a mechanism to authenticate EPHI, a mechanism to encrypt and decrypt EPHI, and policies and procedures to protect EPHI from improper alteration or destruction. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;II. How We Collect and Use Information Provided to Us &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We may collect information in several ways by your use of the Services, as well as from forms you submit to us, or personal correspondence, such as emails or letters that you send to us. We may ask you to voluntarily provide us with personal information in the Services. In addition, when you log onto the Services, our servers may log your IP address, the URL of your request and other information that is provided in the HTTP header. Our third-party service providers may also ask you voluntarily to provide personal information on their websites and may share such personal information with us, as governed by their respective privacy policies. Our use of information received from a service provider will be dictated by the service provider’s privacy policies and not this Privacy Policy. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We collect two types of information: personally identifiable information and non-personally identifiable information, which may include PHI. Personally identifiable information is information that identifies you or can be used to identify or contact you (“Personally Identifiable Information”). We also may collect information that by itself typically cannot be used to identify or contact you, such as demographic information (e.g. age, profession or gender), IP addresses, browser types, domain names, and other anonymous statistical data involving the use of our Services (“Non-Personally Identifiable Information”). &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Personally Identifiable Information we collect may include your name, email addresses, postal addresses, ZIP code, telephone number, credit card information, date of birth, gender, age, user name and password, your product preferences, Services you have used and other information either desirable or necessary to provide quality services to our customers and users. We may also collect information about you such as your use of the Services and communication preferences. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;To the extent we are able to do so, we may link your Non-Personally Identifiable Information with your Personally Identifiable Information. We may also link information collected online with information we collect offline or that is collected online by third parties. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We may use the information collected from you to provide services which you have requested from us. We may use third-party service providers to send and distribute e-mail and to perform other support functions for the Services. We may use information we collect from you to improve the content of our communications, to enhance users’ experiences when using the Services, and to customize the content and layout of the Services for each individual user. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Analytics Information: &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We may use third-party analytics tools to help us measure traffic and usage trends for the Services. These tools collect information sent by your device or our Services, including the web pages you visit, add-ons, and other information that assists us in improving the Services. This information may be transmitted and stored by the third-party analytics tool provider and is covered by that provider’s privacy policy. Such information may be transferred to other third parties when required to do so by law, or to other service providers performing services on the behalf of our third-party analytics tool provider. The information collected may be used for the purpose of evaluating consumer use of the Services, compiling reports on Services activity for our use, and providing other services relating to Services activity and usage. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Cookies, Log Information, Device Identifiers and Metadata: &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Like many other Services, we may use cookies to customize content specific to your interests and track your use of the Services. “Cookies” are text files that are placed on your computer or mobile device and may be used to store your personal information. In addition to cookies, we may use other now known or later developed technologies, to assist us in observing the behavior of users visiting the Services. These technologies access individual user information but the information is used only to compile aggregated statistics about the Services’ usage. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Log file information may be automatically reported by your browser each time you make a request to access the Services. It can also be provided when the content of the Services is downloaded to your browser or mobile device. When you use our Services, our servers automatically record certain log file information, including your web request, IP address, browser type, referring / exi</string>
